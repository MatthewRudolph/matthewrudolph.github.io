## Hi, I'm Matt

These are my development notes

Not really a blog, more a collection of notes made whilst I ~learn~ play with new technologies

### Cheatsheets

I never seem to be able to remember the command and syntax for docker, node, npm, or any shell tools really. There are loads of cheatsheets out there and I'm forver using Goggle to find the right one. This is my own list of commands I use frquently but can never remember the exact name and syntax off.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/MatthewRudolph/matthewrudolph.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
