## Hi, I'm Matt

These are my development notes
Not really a blog, more a collection of notes made whilst I test out and learn about new (and old) technologies

### Cheatsheets

I never seem to be able to remember the command and syntax for docker, node, npm, or any shell tools really. There are loads of cheatsheets out there and I'm forver using Goggle to find the right one. This is my own list of commands I use frquently but can never remember the exact name and syntax off.
